Welcome to Petful, a new pet adoption app. There are the only two types of animals in this shelter: cats and dogs. The adoption process works strictly on a first in-first out basis, and users can choose to adopt either a cat, a dog, or both (but only one at a time). People can only adopt the pets who have been at the shelter for the longest. Once you adopt an animal, you can see the animal's success story with other animals that have been adopted. Admin users can log in and edit the list of pets that are available.
